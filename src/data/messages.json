    "message": "Happy Birthday, Hiteshi ❤️I still can’t believe we became friends because of ishita and an Instagram friend request you randomly decided to send me. One small tap and boom—here we are, one and a half year later, with a whole lot of memories between us.From sitting together in practicals to me shamelessly cheating from you (and you letting me because you’re too sweet), we really started our friendship in a crazy style, I’ve seen you fall in love, glow differently, get your heart full, and take care of people with so much warmth… and somewhere in between all of that, we started taking care of each other too.Our drunk nights, our crying sessions, our conversations about people in our life—those moments are honestly priceless.And … Shastri Market! Me, you, and Ankit roaming around like idiots while it was raining. That day we had maximum fun. The way we laughed that day still feels fresh.and lets not forget our walk to you home jahan you said bss 2 min aur dur h and that 2 min turned in 15 freaking minute of walk Your daily calls, your constant drama, our college chaos where me and ishita daily order our samosas and you sometimes having them with us, You both remembring every person and me forgetting each one of them—these are the things that make my life softer and funnier. You’re honestly one of the very few people I want to keep forever.And you know… you always say you “can’t express yourself.”But you’re wrong.You express yourself in every action, every little gesture—how you show up for us, how you care, how you listen even when you’re tired, how you love even when you don’t say it out loud. Your actions speak louder than any words, and that’s why I believe you’re going to grow into an even better, stronger, and more beautiful person than you already are.I want to be there when you get married, standing somewhere in the crowd screaming, “THAT’S OUR CRAZZY HEAD GETTING MARRIED!”I want to annoy you more in future , babysit your dramatic children, and remind them how their mother used to cry, drink, love too hard, and still survive.You deserve the world, Hiteshi.Thank you for being in my life the way you are.Happy Birthday, idiot. I love you forever. 💛❤️"
